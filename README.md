## Introduction
The Typing Cat Game is a fun and educational game designed to improve players' typing skills while providing an enjoyable gaming experience. Players are challenged to type the words falling before they reach the bottom of the screen.

### Motivation

The motivation for this project came from the desire to practice touch typing in a fun way. While there are great tools available, I saw this as an opportunity to create something custom-made and practice my skills. Additionally, I chose to use this project as the final project for my Harvard's CS50 course.

## Gameplay
- **Intro Screen**: The game starts with an introduction screen where you need to type "PLAY" to start the game or "QUIT" to exit.
- **Playing the Game**: Once in the game, control your cat character using the keyboard to type words displayed on enemies.
- **Defeating Enemies**: Type the correct words to defeat enemies. Be quick and accurate to prevent enemies from reaching you.
- **Scoring**: Your score increases with each defeated enemy. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
