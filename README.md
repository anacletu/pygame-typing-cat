A simple Pygame-based game where players type words to catch falling objects.

## Overview

The Typing Cat Game is a fun and educational game designed to improve players' typing skills while providing an enjoyable gaming experience. Players are challenged to type words associated with falling objects to catch them before they reach the bottom of the screen.

## Project Structure

The project follows a recommended structure with separate directories for game code, assets, tests, and documentation. Additionally, Docker is used for consistent development and deployment environments.

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python and Pygame.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game using the main.py file.

## Usage

Once the game is running, players can navigate menus using the keyboard and type words to catch falling objects during gameplay.

## Disclaimer

The graphics used in this game were created using AI, specifically Adobe Firefly.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project came from the desire to practice touch typing in a fun way. While there are great tools available, I saw this as an opportunity to create something custom-made and practice my skills. Additionally, I chose to use this project as the final project for my Harvard's CS50 course.
